    <h1 class="center">Different Ways to Game</h1>

    <p class="center">From phones to
      exspensive computers,there are many diffrent ways to game. Some people prefer one over the other, whereas some
      people have the abilty to act like adults and can respect that we are all
      gamers. However, for those who can't act like that, here are the pros and
      cons of different ways to game</p>
      <h3 class="center">Consoles</h3>

      <p class="center">First off, we have consoles: the two main ones being PS4 and XBOX,
        which is made by Sony and Microsoft respectively. There's also the weird cousin
        Nintendo, not that it is a bad thing (they just are). The good thing
        about consoles is that they are easy to use (for the most part): you just
        plug and play. This is not a bad thing however they do cap you between
        30fps and 60fps (frames per secound). Although 60fps is good, this to me is
        a downside. Gaming on a PC you can choose your limit as long as
        your computer can handle it. Another huge, and I mean HUGE, downside is that
        they charge you anywhere from $60 to $120 to play online. This is
        crazy since you've already paid for the console and for the game, and
        now, you have to pay to play it.</p>
        <h3 class="center">Computer</h3>

      <p class=center> Next off, we have computers (my personal favorite). Although computer cost more at first,
         they do end up saving you money in the long
        run. On pc games, the cost, on average, is 10% less on games. Also your fps are not limited,
        unlike on console as stated above. Computers also have more custimazation options
        with rgb(red,green and blue) which adds some really cool colors.</p>
        <h3 class="center">Virtual Reality</h3>

      <p class="center"> Last off we have VR (virtual reality), which is kind of a
        sub-catogory of the two since you can use a VR headset on both console
        and PC, I have both and I prefer my PC Vr headset over my Playstation VR
        since there is more games on the PC market for now. Playstation VR is also
        trash becuase you have to stay in one spot and can only look in about 270 degrees whereas
        VR on pc, it is 360 degrees (as long as you remember to step over the wire).</p>

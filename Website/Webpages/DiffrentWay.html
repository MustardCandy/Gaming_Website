    <h1 class="center">Diffrent Ways to Game</h1>

    <p class="center">There are many diffrent ways to game from phones to
      exspensive computers. Some people prefere one over the other, where some
      people have the abilty to act like adults and can respect that we are all
      gamers. However for those who can't act like that here is the pros and
      cons of diffrent ways to game</p>
      <h3 class="center">Consoles</h3>

      <p class="center">First off we have consoles, the two main ones are ps4 and xbox,
        made by sony and microsoft respectivly. Their is also the weird cousin
        Nintedo, not that that is a bad thing they just are. The good thing
        about consoles is that they are easy for the most part they are
        plug and play. This is not a bad thing however they do cap you between
        30fps and 60fps(Frames per secound). Where 60fps is good this to me is
        a downside since gaming on a pc you can choose you limit as long as
        it can handle it. Another huge and I mean HUGE downside is that
        they charge you to play online anywhere from $60 to $120. That is
        crazy to me since you already payed for the console and for the game,
        now you have to pay to play it.</p>
        <h3 class="center">Computer</h3>

      <p class=center> Next off we have Computers(My personal favorite). computers
        where they cost more at first they do end up saving you money in the long
        run. On pc games cost on average 10% on games. Also your fps are not limited,
        unlike on console as stated above. Computers also have more custimazation options
        with rgb(red,green and blue) which add in some really cool colors.</p>
        <h3 class="center">Virtual Reality</h3>

      <p class="center"> Last off we have vr(virtual reality), which is kinda a
        sub-catogory of the two since you can use a vr headset on both console
        and pc, i have both and much prefere my PC Vr headset over my Playstation Vr.
        Since there is more games on the PC market for now. Playstation VR is Also
        you have to stay in one spot and can only look in about 270 degrees where
        VR on pc is 360 degrees (as long as you rember to step over the wire).</p>

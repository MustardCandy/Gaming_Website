    <h1 class="center">Diffrent Ways to Game</h1>
    <p class="center">There are many diffrent ways to game from phones to
      exspensive computers. Some people prefere one over the other, where some
      people have the abilty to act like adults and can respect that we are all
      gamers. However for those who can't act like that here is the pros and
      cons of diffrent ways to game</p>

      <p class="center">First off we have consoles, the two main ones are ps4 and xbox,
        made by sony and microsoft respectivly. Their is also the weird cousin
        Nintedo, not that that is a bad thing they just are. The good thing
        about consoles is that they are easy for the most part they are
        plug and play. This is not a bad thing however they do cap you between
        30fps and 60fps(Frames per secound). Where 60fps is good this to me is
        a downside since gaming on a pc you can choose you limit as long as
        it can handle it. Another huge and I mean HUGE downside is that
        they charge you to play online anywhere from $60 to $120. That is
        crazy to me since you already payed for the console and for the game,
        now you have to pay to play it.</p>

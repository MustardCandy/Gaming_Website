  <p>Ive played games almost my whole life starting with an old super Nintendo i
     didn't know how to use mainly watching my older brother playing games that
     i don't even remember the names of but i still enjoyed every second of it.
     After the Nintendo broke my dad bought us our PS2 and I actually starting
     playing games and like GTA San Adreas, Twisted Metal Black, Maximo ghosts
     to glory, the prince of Persia, god of war, and many other games i still
     love that really got me to love gaming as my favorite hobby. I never got a
     PS3 or Xbox360 I went right to PS4 and started playing GTA5 and The last
     of us which both came with my console when I bought it and spent a while
     floating from single player game to single player game some bad some good
     until I got into online gaming with games like battle field, rainbow six
     siege,gta online, some cod games and more but siege has been my main online
      game for a while now grinding away at ranked for hours with friends.
      currently most of the people play with are ether moving to PC or don't
      play often.</p>
   <h2>Red Dead Redemption 2</h2> <img src="pictures/rd7.jpg" class="img1" alt="Red Dead">
   <p>Red Dead 2 is the presequal to the smash hit by rock star games Red Dead
     Redemption with a compeling story about a retired outlaw John Marston with
     a family who gets forced to out and even hunt down old freinds because of
     a group of law men, but Red Dead 2 is about the origin of the gang John
     cames from and the down fall of it from the perspective of Arthor Morgan a
     member of Dutch Van Der Linde gang (the same gang john joined) as they run
     from the law after a robbory gone wrong they head into the mountions in t
     he begining of the game. The game is butiful and detailed to the point
     where it not hard to mistakescreen shot for actual pictures I would have
     to say it is the most impressive looking game I have ever seen by a good
     margin along with a very compeling story and likable charectors the only
     complaint I can think of would be the combate is nothing new or special
     but its a forgetable complaint when everything else is breath taking and
     extreamly apealing.</p>
